About this infrastructure:
1.What is a server
A server is a physical or virtual computer that provides services to other devices (clients). In this case, it's hosting the web server, application logic, and database to serve a website.

2.What is the role of the domain name
Domain Name (foobar.com): A human-readable address for your website, translated to an IP by DNS.

3.What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
www DNS record: A record www is in www.footbar.com

4.What is the role of the web server
The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests from users. It serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS) and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

4.What is the role of the application server
The application server runs your actual application code (e.g., written in Python, PHP, Node.js, etc.). It processes business logic and communicates with the database.

5.What is the role of the database
The database (MySQL) stores persistent data like user accounts, blog posts, orders, etc. The application server queries or updates the database when needed.

6.What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
The server communicates with the user's browser over the HTTP(80)/HTTPS(443) protocol using the TCP/IP stack.


The issues are with this infrastructure:
1.SPOF(single point of failure).	If one server stops, everything stops. The service is down.
2. Downtime.	Updating or restarting the server causes the service to stop for a while.
3.Scalability.	It can't handle many users at the same time. No extra servers or backups to help.
